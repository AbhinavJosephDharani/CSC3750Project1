  <h1>Courses & Projects</h1>
  <h2>CSC 3110 - Algorithm Design and Analysis</h2>
  <p>This course focused on evaluating algorithm efficiency using asymptotic analysis. Topics included:
    <ul>
      <li>Divide-and-Conquer</li>
      <li>Greedy Techniques</li>
      <li>Dynamic Programming</li>
      <li>Time-Space Tradeoffs</li>
    </ul>
    We also covered NP-completeness and approaches for intractable problems.</p>
  <h2>CSC 4500 - Introduction to Theoretical Computer Science</h2>
  <p>This class explored the theory of computation and formal languages. Key concepts included:
    <ul>
      <li>Finite Automata, CFGs, and PDAs</li>
      <li>Turing Machines and Undecidability</li>
      <li>Pumping Lemmas and Language Hierarchies</li>
    </ul>
    The course built foundational knowledge for understanding the limits of computation.</p>
  <h2>Project Highlight â€“ PhishShield</h2>
  <p>
    PhishShield is a simulated phishing training tool I developed as part of CSC 5272. I co-led UX design and project planning, applying accessibility (WCAG) and Agile workflows. We used AI tools for drafting and iteration, conducted user testing, and refined the UI based on feedback. The project helped me grow in user-centered design, collaboration, and responsible AI integration.
